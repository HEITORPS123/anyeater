# AnyEater

AnyEater is a command-line tool that analyzes Typescript code projects and provides a detailed report on the use of the generic type "any". According to Microsoft`s own Typescript wiki, the use of "any" should be avoided at all costs, only being acceptable in instances where a codebase is being converted from Javascript to Typescript, therefore it should be considered a code-smell.
